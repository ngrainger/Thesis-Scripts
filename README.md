# Thesis-Scripts

Custom perl scripts written to automate data normalization, calculation processes and frequency counting


Use Wave_Stats.pl script for:

> automatically counting frequency of Ca2+ transients/oscillations (total number)
> automatically calculating mean peak-peak (R-R) interval (in seconds)
> automatically calculating the mean amplitude of peaks (in intensity units)
> automatically calculating the peak amplitude standard deviation (in intensity units)

Use Control_wave_normalization.pl script for:

> calculating the normalized Ca2+ wave propagation of the control measurements
> calibrating spatial spread of each Ca2+ wave propagation (in micrometer)

Use Wave_normalization.pl script for:

> calculating the normalized Ca2+ wave propagation of measurements taken after control (i.e. drug application)
> calibrating spatial spread of each Ca2+ wave propagation (in micrometer)
